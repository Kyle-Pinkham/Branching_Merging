Warning: 

Don't edit the same file to appropriate differences in branches or there will be so many 
conflicts your head will spin. Make sure you save differences in the correct branches to 
create them properly.

This file is located in Every branch I am currently working on. If I am working on two branches, 
or three branches at the same time, then I should commit this file seperately on each branch to ensure
they all get it.

In theory, this is what the master branch is for, as I shouldn't need to work on two branches at the 
same time.

Consolidated branches only take up a single horizontal line in the gitKraken network. This is important because 
that way you know which branches are on the same page and which ones are Different.

By commiting this change, I am going to push this simple readme to the main server. Then, I should
be able to merge every branch into master individually and push it into the origin master.
This should ring true even if I add differences to the files.

Why didn't it take my branch changes when I commited it to the web? 

There must have been an issue because it worked when I rebased the master. A problem with the code maybe?

Apparently it is just a matter of waiting for it to post to the server.
